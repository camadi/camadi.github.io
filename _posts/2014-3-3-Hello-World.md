After obtaining my Master of Science degree in Mathematics from Brock University, a professor in the department of Management Information Systems encouraged me to pursue another program with him. The sole purpose was to delve into the field of Big Data. But I declined, because I wanted to do my PhD in Economics. 

After two years, I realized that the Prof. was right. He saw what I could not see. The journey towards Data Science has started. Having worked as a System Administrator, Pension Analyst and Business Analyst, I am now even more excited to explore how my past experiences would aid my Data Science exploit.
